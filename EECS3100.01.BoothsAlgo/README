Performs multiplication of two words using only shifts and add/sub.

The product will be held in AX:DX - the result printed to the screen will only show correctly in decimal format when the product can be contained within a word. 

It still does the multiplication, but it just shows incorrectly on the screen if the product is larger than a word.
