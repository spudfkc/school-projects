@The African buffalo is a very robust species. Its shoulder heigh@t can range from 1 to 1.7 m (3.3 to 5.6 ft) and its head-and-bod@y length can range from 1.7 to 3.4 m (5.6 to 11 ft). Compared wi@th other large bovids, it has a long but stocky body (the body l@ength can exceed the Wild water buffalo, which is rather heavier@ and taller) and short but thickset legs, resulting in a relativ@ely short standing height. The tail can range from 70 to 110 cm @(28 to 43 in) long. Savannah-type buffaloes weigh 500 to 910 kg @(1,100 to 2,000 lb), with males normally larger than females, re@aching the upper weight range. A record-sized savannah-type male@ weighed 1,000 kg (2,200 lb).[2] In comparison, forest-type buff@aloes, at 250 to 455 kg (550 to 1,000 lb), are only half that si@ze.[3][4] Its head is carried low; its top is located below the @backline. The front hooves of the buffalo are wider than the rea@r, which is associated with the need to support the weight of th@e front part of the body, which is heavier and more powerful tha@n the back.
Savannah-type buffaloes have black or dark brown coa@ts with age. Old bulls have whitish circles around their eyes. F@emales tend to have more reddish coats. Forest-type buffaloes ar@e reddish brown in colour with horns that curve back and slightl@y up. Calves of both types have red coats.
The horns of African @buffalo are very peculiar. A characteristic feature of them is t@he adult bull's horns have fused bases, forming a continuous bon@e shield referred to as a "boss", which can not always be penetr@ated even by a rifle bullet. From the base, the horns diverge, t@hen bend down, and then smoothly curve upwards and outwards. The@ distance between the ends of the horns of large bulls is more t@han a metre. The young buffalo horn boss forms fully only upon r@eaching the age of five to six years. In cows, the horns are, on@ average, 10-20% smaller, and the boss is less prominent. Forest@ buffalo horns are much smaller and weaker than those of the sav@annah buffaloes and are almost never fused. They rarely reach a length of even 40 cm.
